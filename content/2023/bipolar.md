## Background

-   I'm 23, the youngest child, two older brothers (9 and 11 years older than me)
-   I have 18 first cousins on my dad's side, most of them are older, and I have learned a lot from them. (Big family = you learn how to get along)
-   I would classify myself as a smartass and a dumbass (I graduated from University of Pittsburgh with a CS degree (a great school by the way, #H2P) and I know how to use the internet to learn information, but sometimes I can be a reckless idiot)
-   My dad is crazy, in good and bad ways depending on the day. His relationship with his family is iffy because he is crazy.
-   I hate hospitals and seeing sick people, it makes me sad.
-   I got allergy shots as a kid, but I hate needles.
-   Torn between two cultures (South Indian & American)
-   I chose not to become a doctor because hospitals and surgeries make me queasy. (A lot of Asian parents push their kids to medicine, but I stood up for myself and was like nah)
-   I consider Philly my roots (Philly is the best worst city in the world). Philly culture means making sarcastic comments to people, but in a loving way. I love Philadelphia and all the communities inside of it.
-   Jack Duffy, a close friend of mine, committed suicide on May 9th 2019. He was an inspiration, had bipolar disorder (I did not know that until a few months ago).
-   Whenever I think about Jack, I feel the urge to cry a little bit, but I was taught not to cry and to suck up your emotions. Turns out that is not a good strategy.
-   I have a really strong support system (between friends and family I felt like I will never be alone)
-   My job is great (stripe.com) and overall not stressful

## Episode 1

-   October 2022, I went to India to see my sick Amachi (Grandma in Malayalam) with my brothers, mom, and sister in laws
-   I felt kind of weird as soon as I got into India. I could not sleep. And for some reason, loud noises while we were driving around would start to bother me (similar to PTSD patients)
-   Had an anxiety/panic attack for the first time in my life. I was accidentally locked in a room and my mind started racing so fast and I got really paranoid that all my friends would commit suicide. My theory for my anxiety/panic attack is there was a lot of interpersonal conflict between my family that was not really a big deal but I blew it up in my head because I was sleep deprived, malnourished
-   Eventually I got out, and a few hours had a fight with my brothers I was taken to Pushpagarri Hospital because my anxiety attack turned into extreme irrationality and I was screaming nonsense
-   I don't trust doctors 100% because my dad taught me that you can never trust institutions and that you can never trust anyone in India. Even though my dad is a huge pain in the ass he is usually right about stuff
-   I refused medication initially, this ended up in me getting tied down and butt injected with a bunch of shit.
-   I did not speak the same language as the doctors and my brain was not correct
-   I calmed down but on the way to the airport I developed a reaction (tardive dyskinesia?)
-   There is a stigma against mental illness in the brown community, which adds a lot is of nuance to this whole story
-   I had an MRI scan done. Turns out I have a cyst in my cerebellum (back of brain). The Indian doctors say it's nothing serious but no one really trusted the Indian doctors. Later on US doctors took a CT scan and I think they said it's residual from Dandy-Walker syndrome or something and kind of ignored it.
-   Flew back to the US in November, my whole family stayed with me in the hospital and we all missed our original flights
-   I was stubborn, I did not trust what the Indian doctors had to say. Through the recommendation of a crisis hotline I went to Bryn Mawr hospital's psych ward. Stayed there for 9 nights. It sucked.
-   Diagnosed with Bipolar I
-   I was pretty stubborn, I did not want to have a mental illness
-   I removed my parents from my HIPPA list because of a fight I had with them over a shitty hospital phone
-   Got put on Depakote (mood stablizer medication)

## Episode 2

-   Discharged and stayed with my Dad
-   I was still manic-ish but and my Dad and I triggered each other and drove each other insane
-   I had a mini hallucination and it made me confused
-   Cops came to my house, ambulance took me to Abington Hospital
-   I was in the hospital so I missed Thanksgiving, my favorite holiday (sadness)
-   Discharged with Lithium and Abilify

## Episode 3

-   Abilify gave me insomnia and tremors (technical term is Akathasia). My grandfather died of Parkinsons so I was getting really anxious by this side effect.
-   I averaged 3 hours of sleep a night for 2 weeks
-   I started doing yoga along with reading and exercise but nothing worked to fix my sleep
-   I tried 4+ combinations of medications to force me to sleep. Nothing worked and I was getting more frustrated and anxious (but not manic)
-   Went to a clinic for in person group therapy, but I was tired and I felt like there was no community there
-   I got a private psychiatrist that put me on Ativan and switched Abilify for Zyprexa
-   3 nights before Christmas I woke up in the night, I was a little manic, and I got I pushed my brother and said something disrespectful to my Dad one night
-   Cops came to my house, ambulance took me to Abington Hospital (yes, again). The cops were more aggressive this time (probably because I was being less compliant)
-   Missed Christmas (sadness)
-   Got injected with a bunch of shit
-   Turns out I was allergic to Haladol?
-   Developed Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, a rare disease (my heart rate went to 160, I could not move, I had a crazy fever, I could not swallow, my whole body was fucked)
-   I barely remember anything from this time. I do remember seeing events from my life flash by, and thought I was going to die (so did my mom who is a nurse, but my mom can be a lil dramatic sometimes).
-   My family panicked and did everything they could to talk to the nurses and doctors to make sure my care was solid, especially since my experience in India was not being taken into account.
-   The NMS got better. I spent 1-2 weeks in restraints on a hospital bed (I was trying to stubbornly run out of the hospital so they restrained me to the bed), which made me feel defeated and angry. I was getting pissed at being restrained and not being able to talk or move.
-   I was also weening off and taking a bunch a fuck ton of random psychotic medication which fucked with my brain, my memory, and my motor skills
-   I had so many nightmares and hallucinations. It felt like I was on fire, I had visions of all of my friends killing themselves. I think the experience was similar to a bad trip
-   Through the help of Medicial Technicians, Nurses, Doctors, my parents, my siblings, and my chachis (sister in laws), I recovered from NMS
-   But, I had to spent 30 more days in the psych ward (which I sometimes refer to as Arkham Asylum because a lot of crazy patients entered that ward) because my brain was fucked from all the mania and medication and needed to be resolved
-   I remember feeling like I could not remember basic facts about me, names of my friends, etc
-   I met deaf patients, a lady with pneumonia that worshiped insects, a psychology student, multiple teachers, a 70 year old that just shouted nonsense all day (he was everyone's favorite patient because you never knew what he was going to do), a coke addict that was really good at singing, and about 10 more people (I wrote stories about them in a personal journal, but I feel like they are not my stories to publicize). Talking to them all gave me so many new life perspectives in such a short term
-   I developed ICU psychosis on top of the psychosis coming from all of the above bullets, so I started getting paranoid that I was never going to leave.
-   I use humor as a defense mechanism sometimes. The hospital did not appreciate my sarcastic comments (this was my attempt to make the stay more fun) or my rambling (rambling is a sign of mania) or disdain for authority (a lot of workers were not doing their job and I called them out on it).
-   I finally got discharged but still was coming down from mania and spent 2 weeks weaning off some medications
-   I had a painful 3 months, but compared to a lot of people this struggle was nothing.

## Through this I realized

Someone going through a mental illness episode barely understands what they need because their mind is thinking weird thoughts. This makes it hard for loved ones to give support. I think the best thing for everyone is to keep a judgement free, open mind and to provide them with patience, optimism, and compassion. Open communication is key. There is a lot of work to be done to reduce the stigma, especially in the Indian community. I reflected a lot while I was stuck in the psych ward and was losing my mind sitting in my hospital, physically alone by myself for extended periods of time. A lot of first generation Indian kids are taught to blindly listen to their parents. If you rebel, your parents will place a huge amount of guilt on you. From my experience South Indian parents typically love their kids, but do not know how to show it at all. Fatherly love feels more obligatitory than authentic, which leads to confusion later on in life. Kids are taught to be successful and to hustle, but are not encouraged to find and follow their passions. This results in a lot of individuals that know how to listen and wrok hard, but are broken in ways they do not even understand. When they go off to college (if they are lucky to do that), they hopefully get to be exposed to new perspectives and cultures to break free from this. In the case where an Indian parent has mental illness, it is ignored, and the kids live their lives witnessing the repercussions of untreated mentall illness and then risk repeating the generational curse of sadness and anxiety. Combine that with general societal norms for guys to be tough and you have a bunch of people with issues (like anxiety for example) that do not have professional therapy because it’s looked down upon. I had anxiety my whole life and thought it was just an unfixable repercussion that came from living with my dad. It also is not straightforward to get therapy. This generational curse makes me sad, because a lot of Indian parents immigrate to America to have better lives for their children, and their lives are definitely better, but they still have to carry the burden of mental illness (sometimes diagnosed, sometimes not). Most South Indians are Christians, and no shade at Christianity. The Bible is great, but I think it is easy to misinterpret it and it can lead to carrying forward a patriarchal system that enables older guys to disrespect their women (which was popularized in popular hip hop culture). All of this is getting way better, because each generation of kids are smarter. Mental illness diagnosis can exist without it being a label. For me personally, I like to think I love myself and I am secure enough in myself that I am proud to carry the bipolar label on me, and I do not care what judgements people make about me.

I do not think I can talk much about a culture that is not mine, but it is obvious prejudice and biases still are present in modern day America. At the end of the day, you can never fully guess what someone is going through. Sometimes you can see hardship in someone's eyes or their stitches, or their wheelchair, but each hardship is complex and unique, so comparision is usually futile. I think it is good for people with different perspectives to come together and civilly share experiences to help expose people to new thought patterns. After 23 years, I finally have a better relationship with my parents. It just took a lot of therapy, talking, going against the grain, yelling, changing habits, and more, but in the long term I know I will be glad my parents and I will be "on the same side."

My parents deal with grief by ignoring it. When my friend Jack passed away, I decided the “strongest” course of action would be to follow what they do, take a deep breath, get over it, and move on with my life. But I thought about it more. Jack would want me to reflect and think about the uncomfortable feelings. He would want me to be happy, truly understand myself and what I value, and live my life with the goal to help as many people as possible (and to find a way to not do it alone).

People will always come and go in your life, but the memories and lessons they teach you will hopefully stick. If you wait long enough, people will surprise you. Up until recently I thought Jack's final lesson to me was to strive to be the best at whatever I did. But now I realized he was always teaching me to try to make a positive impact in the world and to never give up faith in the people around you. My parents basically say the same shit but in a way more annoying and indirect way.

Crazy people are built different. Everyone is built differently, it is the beauty of life, but not everyone thinks different to the point they are considered icons. I'll end my post with two quotes from two people who I think are crazy. One, a legendary baller from Philly and another who is a rapper (who needs to chill out) from Chi-Town.

_Kanye West_: "What the fuck does that mean Kobe Bryant"

People that lived through traumatic experiences and mental illnesses are crazy, but crazy people change the world.

## Resources

I am not a doctor. Here are some resources that helped me as I was going through my diagnosis.

-   **Movie**
    -   Silver Linings Playbook (Funny)
    -   Dead Poets Society (Artistic, Sad)
    -   Good Will Hunting (Classic)
-   **Blog posts**: [The effects of trauma, the role of narratives...](https://peterattiamd.com/estherperel/)
-   **Podcasts**: [Huberman Lab, The Science Treatment of Bipolar Disorder](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/episode-82-the-science-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder-huberman-lab/)
-   **Exercise**: If I was a doctor, I would make this mandatory for my patients. Even if it's just walking. Yoga is a solid thing to do because it forces you to focus on your life.
-   **Charlie Health**: This is where I do my Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), it is group therapy and pretty helpful
-   Be careful about Googling your symptoms. A lot of the time your personal bias will harm your ability to get the right information and make you believe incorrect ideas that can harm you.
