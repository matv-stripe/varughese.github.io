					have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something – your gut,
					destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the
					confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path; and that will make all the
					difference.”</p>
